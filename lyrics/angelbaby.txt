I need a lover to keep me sane
Pull me from hell bring me back again
Play me the classics
Something romantic
Give him my all when I don't even have it
I always dreamed of a solemn face
Someone who feels like a holiday
But now I'm in pieces, barely believing
Starting to think that I've lost all feeling

You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
I tell you how I almost died, while you're bringing me back to life

I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word forever
Until you give up heaven so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

I'll fall in love with the little things
Counting the tattoos on your skin
Tell me a secret
And baby I'll keep it
And maybe we can play house for the weekend

You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
I'll tell you how I almost died
While you're bringing me back to life

I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word forever
Until you give up heaven so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

All the sick and twisted nights that I've been waiting for ya
They were worth it all along, yeah

I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word forever (Ooh, forever)
Until you give up heaven so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby
Angel, angel baby (You're my angel, baby)
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby
